# stonks

Stonks is a program that lets you anticipate your net worth in years to come. It accounts for your starting capital, your salary, your estimated salary appreciation over years, and capital compounding on investments.
You can also add temporal events that change these parameters. Stonks will then compute how your net worth will grow over time.
